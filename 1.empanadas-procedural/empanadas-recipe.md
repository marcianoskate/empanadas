### Ingredients for Dough

### Dough Preparation:
1. Mix the flour and salt in the food processor.
2. Add the butter, egg, and water (or milk) slowly while mixing until small soft dough balls begin to form.
3. Remove the dough from the food processor and form the dough into a ball
_If you do not have a food processor_, follow the instructions and mix everything together using your hands. Knead the mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated and a smooth dough is obtained. You can add additional water or milk if the dough is dry.
4. Split the dough into balls - Split the dough into balls considering how big you want your empanadas (approx 12). You can use these balls immediately or refrigerate for 1 to 2 days.
5. Make disks of dough. Flatten out the dough using a rolling pin and cut disks of the size you want (use a mold, a plate, or a cup). Alternatively, use a tortilla press to flatten each dough ball. These disks can be used immediately or stored in the fridge for 1 to 2 days. Freeze if you want to preserve for longer.
